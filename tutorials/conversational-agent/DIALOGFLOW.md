# Google Dialogflow

## Setting up Google Dialogflow Console

1. Open the google dialogflow console in a web browser. [Google Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)

2. Sign in with __PERSONAL__ google account (Do not use KSU email address for this because KSU account has some restrictions for creating projects in GCP)

3. From the navigation menu on the left, find the option where it says __CREATE AGENT__. Select that one.

4. Give your conversation agent a name. We'll need this name when we are writing codes for Dialogflow agent.

5. Two default intents are present in there. (Default fallback intent and Default Welcome Intent)

6. On the top right, find the button that says "CREATE INTENT". Create a new intent with this button.

7. Click on __ADD TRAINING PHRASES__. Here you can add what do you want the conversation to be like.

8. You can add multiple intents to handle a specific set of user expressions (what the users might say for a specific task).
